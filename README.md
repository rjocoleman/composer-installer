A library for installing Blesta extensions using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or later
- Composer 2.0 or later

## Usage

To use simply add `blesta/composer-installer` as a requirement to your extension's `composer.json` file,
and tell composer which type of extension you've created.

```json
    "type": "blesta-plugin",
    "require": {
        "blesta/composer-installer": "~2.0"
    }
```

In the above example, we've set `blesta-plugin` as the type of composer package.
See below for a complete list of supported types, and choose the appropriate one for your extension.
